"Value your own worth and only give what you can afford, don't overdo it by giving everything away"
I think you should still have more money than person who gets the endowment
Equality my friend equality. Sometimes it feels cool and right to be greedy but all that really does is make the whole wide world miserable and make most humans unable to feel joy imagine living in a world where we all feel joy easily. Share the money share the good share it all. Find joy 
This is getting boring. Toi much thought for something so simple. Just pay attention.
if you don't allocate any then you keep all of your tokens. If you split half/half you both walk away with the same amount
This seems like the fairest action that I can take to give us both something back.
If you choose low you are guaranteed to keep as many tokens as possible. 
"The less you give the more you receive, so it is your decision to do the right thing"
Always choose a win-win situation... hopefully you'll find another person that think the same
"Fair distribution approach in this game. Even though B can't decide it is better to share tokens with B. The roles might have been easily reversed, so better to share tokens."
Be wise. follow the rules. do the calculations fot the best outcome for both payers in the study
"According to the iteration the most logical choice to make is to bet 50 tokens so, if the other player makes the same move, there is a high probability of earning 50 tokens"
Please chose 50 token to alocate to B. if 50 is your choice I will gain 50 (100-50) and you will gain 50. Everyone wins the same.
"I choosed to give what I though it was a good amount of tokens, to receive some if I got the A function"
"Think what would you like to person A to do if you were B - I wouldn't expect A to give me more than they receive, imagine they're your friend"
if you go by 50 you are making sure that you at least have the most you can get by your own desitions instead of hoping you get to be A
"I think you should be fair and give half to your partner, so we all get the same"
"You decide how much to keep by giving what you want to the other player. If you split in a half, everyone gets the same amount."
Just don't play this is confusing my head and I'm normally quite savvy with these sorts of things 
There is no pont trying to get one over on someone else.  you shoiuld aim to maximise the win for all.  its best to spilt the pot evenly
I'd allocate a little bit. This would be for the greater good. I wouldn't donate more than this though.  
I went for what is morally wrong but serves me the best. It may not be the nicest thing to do!
It is always better to take the action you wish someone would take if they were in your position
"Just give them all to me, trust me, thats the best option to do. "
"This is just giving away tokens to the other player, if you want to."
Allocate zero to B and you get all 100. This is the way to maximize your tokens. This is a good choice after being conservative with your choices in the other interactions.
If you are role A don't contribute to role b for maximum profit.
"Sharing is caring, if we all stick together we can conquer the greed."
"You are given one of two roles, a or b. Role a gets to allocate tokens (out of 100) and role b has no say in the matter "
"Donating 50 keeps it fair. If I was role B, I would like it if the 100 tokens were split evenly. "
"This one didn't take any thought, I just went with what was fair."
Splitting the tokens equally is the fairest so if you are position A allocate the other player 50 tokens.
"I like to share so we both win, please do the same. If either of us pick a higher amount then we both could possibly lose."
I think you should give a solid portion but no more than 50 tokens as that puts you in a less well off position than the person in role b
I keep what I didn't allocate to B. But it is nice to allocate some to B even though I didn't give a lot. 
"It is fair to split it equally as they have nothing, although you might consider keeping the 100!"
"If you are role a you're in charge of allocating. If your role b you don't do anything, just accept your allocation from role a. Role a gets whatever is remaining (from 100) after allocating to role b"
I chose 50 as it is down the middle and I may not lose so much with that amount
"Unless the roles are to be switched on the next round, do not allocate anything. If they are to be switched then allocate around half in the hopes that they will return the favour in the next round"
I would like the other person to receive something. but at the same time I have to look out for myself. so that's why I only gave a little to the other person
It seems fair to split 50/50 as one player has not done more than the other.
I think the right choice is that with the fairest outcome for all. an even split.
You have to ask what everyone else would choose. Anything you give is subtracted directly from you.
Share and share alike seems to be the best way so stick to the middle
It depends how fair you want to be. As you've been given Role A you have control over how many tokens each player gets so you have the power to reward yourself more if that's what you want. 
"I feel that is fair to both players, I would feel guilty taking the full amount "
"I would give myself more, but not too much more because the only work I had to do was make a decision of how much to pass down. "
50/50 seems fair to allocate for the exercise as both sides gain a similar amount 
To play fair give half your tokens away. So you both get the same number
"Sharing will benefit you, maybe not instantly but at some point so think before choosing "
"Fairly easy here. Treat the other player as you would want them to treat you. Just share it, if everyone does that it is all fair."
"Again, no tokens were yours to begin with. You are still gambling on aoyher persons good will and in this case, i have the good will. So why not be fair woth hopes of the other person possibly have done the same"
50 tokens is probably the most fair. I suppose you should choose the amount you'd want to receive if the roles were reversed 
"Clearly, if you assume Role A the best way to play would be to allocate 0 Tokens to Role B so that you keep all 100 of them. But this is rather greedy."
I thought I would play it safe and allocate half of my tokens to player B 
In this role (role A) it would be better to give role B less tokens as your pay out will be bigger
"Well it depends on individual. If you want to share, thrn allocate 50 tokens. If you want to get more tokens allocate 0."
Allocating 50 gives the best chance if everyone goes this. If you are greedy and feel lucky allocate zero and keep the rest. If you feel unlikely go half way.
"I would just keep all the 100 tokens. You want to make as much as you can ultimately, unless you know the person. Why give away something in what is a game?"
"I suggest allocating 50 tokens as that gives both of you 50 tokens each, resulting in the fairest outcome"
It is the fairest possible amount. Sharing resources is the solution to many a problem
"Id like to think this is fair, think about what the oponent has done and act on it"
"I have allocated 50 as I know that role B will get 50 too.  I think you should do the same.  I think this is fair, as Role B has no say in what he will get"
Please pay attention and respond well if your assigned A by looking after your tokens
If you want all the endowment don't allocate any any you will have all the 100 tokens
B's payout depends on what you give them. if you want to be nice then you could go 50-50. if not then allocate B whatever you want
"There are 2 roles in this interaction, Role A & Role  B. There is a 100 token endowment. If you have role A you get to allocate the tokens to role B and whatever is left is yours. If you are role B you get whatever is given to you by role A. "
"I would go about 25, not too high but if I end up being allocated what I have given I dont want too low either. Morally you should probably pick 50%"
"Well I think that an egoistic player would maximize his gain by not allocating any token to B. Yet, I do not perceive this as fair because I also could have been player B. However, I am lucky here to allocate the tokens so I also want to have a bigger gain simply because it is possible."
"If i dont allocate anything to b, im going to win 100 - 0 , so 100 tokens in the tradeoff. If i alocate 10, i just receive 90 tokens so the smart decision is to dont allocate any token at B "
this will ne nice if everybody will have the same amount of tokens
Since you don't know what is your role you either win some or lose some. I played safe and only sent 20
The most reasonable decision now is to keep all of the money to yourself
Do not be selfish and give an opportunity for the other participant to get some tokens
To be fair allocate half your tokens.  This makes it fair for all.  To get the most though don't allocate any
"As Role A, the fair choice is half (50) of your tokens.There's no loser and no winner.  This is the amount I would have liked to be allocated to me if the roles were reversed. Treat others the way you want to be treated."
"Im a simple guy, a man of values and the right way is to allocate the half"
"Best to go fifty fifty on this as you may lose, there's already lose of control, so take a risk "
"if you are lucky to be role A, keep most of the tokens for yourself cause thats life"
 Make your decision wisely. Each decision allows you to increase your profits at the end of the game.
"Just be a fair person but always think of yourself first. it's okay to give tokens as a matter of loyalty, but it's still better to always keep a bigger part because you don't know if the other person would have done the same thing with you"
 i was a bit selfish not the worst but a twenty percent selfhish to you
Be fair with the answers you give out. Choose a morally. correct outcome for both of you two 
"If you are in Role A, your payoff is 100 tokens minus what you allocate to Role B, If you are in Role B, your payoff is what Role A allocates to you"
"if u are role A just give what your heart tells you, hoping you will not be (too) selfish"
"I believe that allocating 50 Tokens to the other player is the safe option. Even if I will be A I will still have 50 Tokens, and the Other player will be having fair half of tokens. I believe that this is the right choice in accordance with my conscience, and choice that won't affect my interests."
"You should allocate 50 tokens to Role B, so both players can get the same amount of tokens"
I am willing to give a good sum to player B but I want to have the advantage too
If you want to do the socially right thing then split it 50/50 with the other person if youre player a
its kinda obvious that 50 its a win win 
"Well I decide to give you the most I could, hope this fine, because I think it's the best option for both"
You need to care about tokens. Maximise your gain. Play with wits.
Making the decision yourself is less risky than to be at the mercy of the other person's decision making
I think that the right outcome it will be the one who equilibrates things
If you select 50 you and your partner will have the same benefit.
"I split the tokens in half, so I get 50 and the other person gets 50"
I would give him a decent amount of tokens so as not to seem stingy
it is better to be equitable with those who do not have and depend on one
It is important to collaborate with others and share any rewards equally
"The more tokens you allocate, the more tokens you'll get, do the right thing."
"Hi, for this action you will be to decided or accept the tokkens, at the end you can divide the amount as equal or not if you read carefully the options"
50 seems fair . We will have the same cut. No one feels cheated. I would hope the person appreciates the gesture 
"It's best to split in equal parts, no one wins and no one looses."
"Still be empathic and you can make a difference, don't think only in you "
How many tokens you allocate to role b will be retracted from your balance
Your decision depends on how much you want to help the other player. I chose to allocate myself more tokens.
"You need to be fair with the tokens you are choosing to give a way, so we both have enough"
"If you want to earn as much money as possible, don't give anything back to the other player "
"Am I just supposed to describe what I chose to give? I gave 30 tokens, so the next person should give 30"
I gave my counterpart 25 so that way they will get some no matter what. But I kept more than half in case my counterpart did not give me any
"Treat others with kindness, you don't know their challenges. Be financially and morally responsible. Choose your future wisely, think it through. "
"For A, The amount you give will be the amount you lose. If your B, then you dont get a choice"
Being fair will make you feel better about yourself. The other player might deserve it. Have some class
I chose my first instincts to go with. I chose a lower amount. after thinking about it im going with the lower amount
I would share equally between myself and my partner. It is the fairest. I would not be selfish. 
Splitting the tokens 50/50 is the best way to do it. This way everyone gets an equal share.
I would choose random numbers and see what happens. There is no rhyme or reason to this. Just choose 100 and see what happens.
Do what you feel in your heart.  Everyone needs money.  Everyone falls on hard times.
There is no incentive to give B anything.  I'm not sure why I would allocate to B.  There is no penalty for not allocating to B.
"I just am doing my best to try to maximize all winnings, this sure is a lot of writing for only $1. I would have not taken this survey if knew I needed to write 3 sentences each page."
We both have 100 tokens. No reason to redistribute them. Filling out this space with more characters.
An even split benefits both myself and the other player. They aren't able to choose whether they are Role A or B but they should still benefit from the interaction. This way ensures that we both leave happy.
"Allocate the most. In this fashion we can hope to achieve the most. If everyone does this, it will have the highest payout"
"This one is up to you -- do what makes you feel right. Allocating 0 tokens maximizes your payoff. If you want to be generous, give more tokens. I gave a portion to the other person (less than half) expecting them to do the same."
"I could stiff them and take all 100. I won't though, I'll share 50/50. It's the moral thing to do. "
Be sure to pay attention to your role and the instructions. Make sure your match is correct.
"If I allocate half of the tokens to the other player, then we will both benefit by an equal amount."
It seems fair to half the tokens between us.  It would not be right for me to take more than 50%. 
It's half of the tokens which is fair. Split it evenly and everyone will have some
It is important to be fair to both players and i feel that is the most appropriate way to move forward
"I suggest 50 tokens. It's the fairest option for everyone, you and the other participant get the same amount this way"
"If you're playing to maximize your gain and not concerned about supporting the other player, keeping all of the tokens will maximize your payoff. I would suggest doing a 50-50 split to share the wealth your partner though. That would be the moral/socially conscious choice."
I would rather keep all the money for myself. I don't want to allocate any to the other participate and they have to accept what I decided. 
If there are only two teammates then they should share the tokens equally.  Both members are important.  It's only fair
It's best to split the tokens. Role B always gets less..it's only fair to split it evenly between the two players in my opinion.
I'm not good at this and not sure I understand. I allocated half and hope that the other person did the same. 
I just want to be fair and not undercut anyone else. We can all thrive 
"You have no risk so you could maximize your profit by keeping all the tokens for yourself. With that said, that certainly isn't the fair option. For this reason I would suggest giving the other player half if you are apt to want to be fair."
I would like to split what I have so that we both have something 
I believe it is fair to split the endowment. We should look out for each other. Regardless of external needs we are better together. 
"Choose 20 coins. I think it would benefit us both. However, you never know if the other person will be greedy. Always be cautious. "
I gave half because that's exactly half and that would be fair. I hope you think it's fair.
You can be greedy and take it all if you're in role A. That is not morally right. You should try to be as fair as possible.
I wanted to make a good faith donation and contribution and do so while still preserving my money in the entire process. 
"*Consider Fairness: In many cultures, fairness is a value that people appreciate. Giving a portion of your endowment that is perceived as fair (e.g., a 50/50 split) might be satisfying to you, especially if your personal values align with the notion of fairness."
"*Evaluate Your Self-Interest: If your main objective is to maximize your own tokens, giving the minimum (0 tokens) would achieve that. However, this approach disregards any social norms of fairness and altruism."
"*Reflect on Altruism: If your personal satisfaction comes from helping others, you may choose to give away a larger portion, or even all of your endowment. This is purely a personal choice and depends on how much you value altruism."
"*Think about Future Interactions: While this is a one-shot game with no direct repercussions, if you're playing in a setting where players may remember your actions (like a classroom or an online gaming community), being generous may influence how others interact with you in the future."
*Understand the Game's Simplicity: This game is straightforward with no strategic complexity since the second player has no strategic input. Your decision essentially reflects your personal values and strategic considerations rather than a response to the potential actions of the other player.
*This game is unique among game theory games in that it's more a measure of your preferences and character than a strategic puzzle to be solved. It's an opportunity to think about what's important to you and make a decision that aligns with your values.
"*Understand the game. In this game, one player has complete control over how a sum of money is divided between themselves and another player. The recipient has no say in how the money is divided."
*Consider your own preferences. How much do you value fairness and equality? How much do you value your own personal gain? Your own preferences will play a big role in how you decide to play the game.
"*Think about the other player. What are their likely preferences? How do you think they will react to your decisions? It is important to try to understand the other player's perspective, even though you cannot communicate with them."
"*Be aware of the stakes. In this game, there is no future interaction between the two players. This means that there is no incentive to be fair or cooperative. One can simply keep all of the money for themselves, if they so choose."
"*Make a decision. Ultimately, the decision of how to divide the money is up to you. There is no right or wrong answer, and it is important to make a decision that you feel comfortable with."
"*Be generous. If you are feeling generous, you could give the recipient all of the money. This would be the fairest outcome, but it would also mean that you would get nothing for yourself."
"*Be selfish. If you are feeling selfish, you could keep all of the money for yourself. This would be the most beneficial outcome for you, but it would be unfair to the recipient."
"*Find a middle ground. You could also choose to give the recipient some of the money, but not all of it. This would be a compromise between fairness and selfishness."
"*Ultimately, the best way to play this game is to understand the game, consider your own preferences, and think about the other player. If you can do all of these things, you will be able to make a decision that you feel comfortable with."
"**Strategic Generosity: While you have the power to allocate as few tokens as you wish to Role B, consider the broader implications. If you play similar games or interact with the same group of participants in the future, being overly selfish could tarnish your reputation. A generous or fair allocation can build goodwill for future interactions."
"**Role Empathy: Before deciding on the allocation, put yourself in Role B's shoes. How would you feel receiving the amount you're considering giving? While the game is played only once and there's no direct consequence for being stingy, your internal satisfaction might be higher knowing you made a decision that treated both players respectfully. Remember, the game is not just about maximizing tokens, but also about the human experience and the feelings that come with it."
"**nderstanding Power Dynamics: As Role A, you hold all the power in this interaction, which can be both liberating and burdensome. While it's tempting to prioritize personal gain, be mindful of the inherent responsibility that comes with such power. A more balanced allocation not only showcases integrity but also acknowledges the inherent value of both participants in the game."
"**The Psychological Element: Research has shown that individuals who act generously often experience a boost in mood and overall well-being. By allocating a reasonable amount to Role B, you might find a personal sense of satisfaction that goes beyond the mere accumulation of tokens. This psychological reward can be as, if not more, valuable than the tokens themselves."
"**Consider Long-Term Impacts: Even if this game is played only once, the choices we make can have lasting effects on our psyche and how we approach similar situations in the future. Being overly self-centered might set a precedent for future actions and decisions, while being fair and considerate can foster a mindset of equity and compassion. Always consider the type of player you want to be, not just in this game, but in the broader scope of life and interactions."
"**The Ripple Effect: Decisions made in such games can sometimes have unintended consequences beyond the immediate interaction. If other participants hear about extremely generous or extremely stingy allocations, it might influence their behavior in similar situations. "
**The best strategy for the Dictator in the dictator game is to keep all the money for themselves. This is because they have all the power and the Recipient has no way to punish them for being unfair.
"**Ultimately, the decision of how much to offer the Recipient is a strategic one for A, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer."
"**Consider the Recipient's feelings. Even though the Recipient has no way to punish you, they may still be upset if you keep all the money for yourself. This could damage your reputation or make it more difficult to cooperate with them in the future."
"**Think about the role of emotions. Emotions can play a big role in the game. If you are feeling generous, you may be more likely to offer the Recipient some of the money. Conversely, if you are feeling selfish, you may be more likely to keep all the money for yourself."
