"*Analyze risk tolerance: Reflect on your tolerance for risk. If you're risk-averse, choosing 'Yellow' gives you a smaller, but guaranteed reward. If you're risk-tolerant and can afford to get no reward, 'Blue' may be a reasonable gamble."
"*Assess the payoffs: Consider the potential rewards for each strategy. If the reward for choosing 'Blue'Â  is substantially higher than 'Yellow', it could be worth the risk, especially if you're comfortable with potentially gaining nothing."
"*Evaluate your opponent: Although there's no communication, any previous knowledge about the other player's behavior or tendencies can be useful. If they're known for taking risks, they might be more inclined to choose 'Blue', and vice versa."
"*Think about loss aversion: Most people are more upset by losses than they are pleased by equal gains. If you are one of these people, 'Yellow' might be the better option, as it guarantees you won't walk away empty-handed."
"*Be unpredictable: If the other player knows you well and can predict your actions, it might be worth being unpredictable. This can be particularly relevant if the other player is likely to mirror your actions, but you suspect they'll choose 'Yellow'."
"*Remember, there's no definitive 'correct' strategy in this game, or indeed in many game theory scenarios. The best decision often depends on the specific situation and the personalities and preferences of the players involved."
"*Consider the other player's likely strategy. If you think the other player is likely to cooperate, then you should cooperate with blue as well. However, if you think the other player is likely to defect with yellow, then you should play yellow as well."
"*Be aware of the incentives. In the game, the best outcome for both players is to cooperate and choose the blue strategy. However, there is a risk that the other player will defect and choose the yellow strategy. If that happens, you will be better off playing yellow as well."
"*Be willing to take a risk. There is always a risk that the other player will play yellow, even if you cooperate with blue. However, if you are willing to take that risk, you can potentially achieve the best outcome for both players."
"**Weigh the Certainty vs. Potential: Choosing Yellow guarantees you a payout of 50 tokens, ensuring you don't walk away empty-handed. If you're risk-averse or believe your counterpart might prioritize their own guaranteed payoff, Yellow might be a safer choice."
"**Greed vs. Mutual Benefit: Choosing Blue presents the chance for the highest reward, but it also comes with the risk of receiving nothing. If both players are altruistic and hope for the best collective outcome, Blue is the optimal choice. However, without communication or knowledge of the other player's tendencies, this is a gamble."
"**You could choose Blue and get the bonus payoff of 100 tokens. However, this is a risky strategy, as there is always a chance that the other player will choose Yellow and you will get nothing."
"**Intuition and Game Theory: In a single-round game without communication, you're essentially guessing your counterpart's choice. Historically, in such dilemmas, many players tend towards self-preservation (i.e., choosing Yellow for the guaranteed payout). Gauge how much you're willing to risk for the potential of a higher reward versus the certainty of a smaller one."
"**Assess the Stakes: Reflect on what the tokens mean to you. If walking away with nothing would be a significant disappointment, the guaranteed 50 tokens from choosing Yellow might be more appealing. On the other hand, if you're feeling adventurous and the idea of a bigger reward excites you, you might lean towards Blue."
"**Only choose Blue if you are confident that the other player will also choose Blue. This is the only way to get the bonus payoff of 100 tokens.
Be aware that the other player may also choose Yellow, in which case you will get nothing. So, it is generally safer to play Yellow."
"**Human Nature and Predictability: Historically, when faced with uncertainty, many individuals opt for a sure thing. With that in mind, there's a fair chance your counterpart might go for the guaranteed 50 tokens by choosing Yellow. This doesn't mean you should necessarily do the same, but it's worth factoring into your decision."
"*Ultimately, the best way to play this game with no communication is to be aware of the incentives, consider the other player's likely strategy, and be willing to take a risk. If you can do all of these things, you will increase your chances of achieving the best outcome for both players."
"Play to always get some reward, even if it is small. Your time is valuable and make sure you put a high enough worth on it"
"Always choose the safest option, passive income is better than no income"
Be safe. Sometimes money is not easy to come by and when playing games of chance where there is an option where it's not chance but guarantee of pay out take it. Gambling sucks. I mean sometimes it pays but sometimes it sucks 
"You still get 50 tokens. You don't have to get the most, something is better than nothing."
if you play safe you're guaranteed money. I chose blue because I like the idea of taking a risk in a controlled environment
I am hoping that the other player is prepared to take a gamble. Hopefully we will both choose blue each time.
I would suggest choosing yellow over blue to guarantee getting 50 tokens.
"Yellow is the most logical if you want to win something, but blue, although less secure, gives you more"
"Go for blue 100%... no matter what, if there's a change, go for the win-win solution"
"Start by signalling your intention to gain most for both. Observe the actions of the other. If they also started with Blue, then stick with blue. If not, then see their response in 2nd interaction to decide next."
"Choose the best color. Follow the rules and use them to guide you, goodluck"
The best way to get more points is to choose yellow most of the time. I think this one has more chances of winning.
"Think smart, not hard. Have fun and enjoy. Trust your choice/ decision."
"If you choose blue, we will both win, that's the best choice you can made."
"Go to yellow cause it will payoff, or try to think to what most people will get, and try to benefit from that"
"If you are desperate for any bonus, choose yellow. I chose blue because I hope the other person would do the same so we can both get  a nice bonus and I feel like trusting the other person and seeing they did the same will be more satisfying than getting smaller bonus!"
"Choose the one that iworks best for the two of you, not the one that will only help yourself"
"Don't choose yellow, we can choose always blue, so we both win. I'll choose blue for your information. I'll hope you do the same"
"Both blue, 100 tokens each. both yellow, 50 tokens each. blue and yellow, no tokens. so pick blue."
Just a game of luck choose which ever you feel is the better hand or don't gamble at all
"Trust in the goodness of people.  Its very easy to not want to trust people, but in this instance, its worthwhile to believe that others will do the right things as well"
I'd just pick blue. Blue ensures you would potentially get the most money. Might as well do a small risk for the money. 
Pick yellow because you are guarenteed a payout. if you pick blue then you may end up with nothing. It's not about the value.
If choosing one option is going to be beneficial to both of you equally it makes the most sense.
Choose the same - blue and we both get 100. Don't choose yelllow or a different colour to me
"I can't recall the rules, but I think it was best to choose blue as that maximises the number of tokens."
Choose yellow because you are guaranteed 50 tokens. If you chose blue there is a good chance the other person will choose yellow and you get nothing. If you choose blue you have to hope the other person chooses blue.
Always pick yellow to guarantee an award la la la la la la la la la
"Always share the goods, its nice to share, sharing makes the world a nicer place."
"Chose a colour either blue or yellow, this will determine the number you get. By choosing yellow, you get 50 and by choosing blue you get 100"
I would suggest always picking yellow. I believe most will pick yellow due to the guarantee of 50 tokens. I would also not like to stop anybody else getting tokens if those chosen yellow and I chose blue.
I tried to imagine what the other player would do to help make my choice.
If you both choose blue you get more and there is no downside for both choosing blue 
If you choose yellow - we both get 50 points which is great. If you choose blue and I don't you get 100 points.
"I think playing blue is the best choice assuming that the other player has the same thought. You are both choosing the option that has the same outcome, so you are helping each other out."
"We should both go for blue. This is the best option, it works out best for all parties "
Yellow is the safest option each time although Blue could work out well I would stick with yellow for a guaranteed pay off
"If you go yellow you're guaranteed an outcome of 50 tokens. If you go blue you may get 100 tokens however this is only guaranteed if the other user also chooses blue. If you choose blue whilst the other person chooses yellow, you get 0"
"I think its a good chance that the other player will choose blue, we would then both get some tokens"
it is best to play it safe and go yellow with the certaintly that you will receive 50 tokens rather than risking it all to get 100 with the chance to get 0
I think using yellow is the safest best. if you choose blue and someone else chooses yellow you get nothing. blue you have a chance at 100 tokens but I think yellow is the safest bet
I chose blue as I would just hope the other player would want both to receive a payoff but if you aren't bothered and want to guarantee a bonus then pick yellow
"I think it's always better to guarantee yourself a smaller win, than try and be greedy and risk losing it all. plus you may make the other player smile and that's always a good thing."
We need to both choose blue so we maximise our profits. It is mutually beneficial for us to both select blue.
Yellow guarentees 50 unless we are allowed to agree with each other that we will press blue
The best outcome seems to be both picking blue so you would hope that's what the other player does. Both choosing yellow guarantees a return but both choosing blue is far higher 
"I personally feel as I don't know to other player, I would assume they would take the highest token amount possible "
"Yellow you are always guarenteed. If you choose the blue one, you can make a higher payout, or nothing. Hard to trust others choices when one option is always guarenteed."
Pick the lower option to avoid both selecting the higher option. So I have selected yellow as it is less likely that someone will go for that as it's lower.
If you want to be guaranteed some tokens choose yellow. If you want to risk doubling your tokens choose blue and hope your playing partner also went for blue.
"If you choose Yellow, you're bad vibes and you earn less overall by being selfish and immoral"
"I'd just hope the other player goes for blue. It's obvious that yellow is the better choice as then you do get something, but why not go for blue. Be a bit brave and daring, what's the worst that can happen?"
"Tokens you had before are none and its only possible tokens that can be obtained. Since were gambling on the other person choosing what we might, why not choose greater than less. Give people the benefit of the doubt, in either case, the tokens you will have were never yours. Maybe you can make more off hope."
Yellow is probably the smarter thing to do. I did the opposite of what I thought I should do
"Yellow is the option that has a guaranteed reward, but Blue has a chance of double that reward. Assuming people won't just pick Yellow to be greedy, then Blue is the best option"
I chose to play yellow as either way you will win tokens. Yellow is a guaranteed win although a win from blue gives you a bigger win 
It works out best and fairer to choose yellow as neither player can lose that way
Select the blue response always so that both will get 100 tokens each 
You gave to decide how lucky you feel. If you feel lucky choose blue. If you feel unlucky and want to play safe choose yellow. Good luck.
"I am feeling risk averse today and have opted for the 50 guaranteed tokens. It's ultimately up to your risk preference. Go blue if you are a risk taker, or yellow if risk averse."
"I think it's worth taking the risk and going blue as I expect that's what most people will do, if you want to be safe though and go with yellow, that's completely ok too"
"Chance it, I feel there is an equal possibility either way. There is no way of predicting what the other person will do"
"I do not trust them, i will go with the option thnat gives me something either way"
"If we both choose blue, we both do very well.  We will both end up with 100 units each.  That sounds like a good strategy"
"Play with your own initiative, and do not copy your counterparts "
If you choose yellow you are always guaranteed to win so the risk is less
"the yellow is guaranteed to give you 50 no matter what you choose. however, blue gives both players the highest outcome if you both pick it. so it would be a good idea to pick blue"
"Take your time to understand the interaction rules, read all instructions properly and answer questions thoughtfully."
Go for the highest amount and hope that your counterpart does the same. I think if you do that you have more chance of winning more. You might not do as it is a gamble but I suggest going for blue
"I think that the counter player is playing it safe in the first round, thus choosing yellow and that is why I am going for blue to maximize my tokens"
The other guy should pick the yellow to receive a bonus. If he picks blue too no bonus will be apply to him
"it would be nice if everybody choose blue, then everybody will have 100 tokens for each actions"
"One interaction, try blue. If everyone thinks like that, you'll be off with a good start."
Yellow is the safest option - you always gain 50 tokens no matter what your opponent pick.
Just think what is the best for you and do it. Remind that both of can win so do not be selfish and try to do your best.
Picking blue would give highest reward.  If everyone picks that then we all win.  Yellow is a safer option though
"You have to trust that your counterpart will also choose Blue, since the payoff will be higher. The only reason they wouldn't choose Blue is if they thought that you wouldn't, so I guess they have to trust you too. Trust leads to higher gains."
"The blue one is the option to win the most, so i took my chances, i think the other participant will pick blue aswell "
It's best to go with the option that gets you more tokens (money) it's a risk but it's worth more than 50 tokens
choose yellow every time so you always win and you dont risk losing 50 tokens
The most important thing is trust. Remember that. Better to have three times more than three times less.
"In my opinion, choosing blue is too risky. To be sure of always winning you should choose yellow"
"in this game we are a team, we will not play against each other and the sky is the limit"
You should be consistent with your answers. You should choose the best outcome for the both of you two.
If you choose yellow you will get 50 tokens regardless of the other person's response
"if you really dont want to end empty handed , go safe and choose yellow"
"In my opinion, the safe option is to choose yellow. Then the player gets a guaranteed 50 Tokens. However, I believe that many other players may choose the Blue option."
Choose blue because that option gives both player more tokens without any problem
"My advice to a future player in this game would be to consider the potential outcomes of each strategy before making a decision. While choosing Yellow may guarantee a certain payoff, there is also the possibility of both players receiving a higher payoff if they both choose Blue. It is important to balance the potential risks and rewards of each strategy and make a decision that is in line with one's goals and risk tolerance. communication and coordination with the other player can increase the chances of both players achieving a higher payoff."
Just go with what you want take the risk with blue or go guarsnteed with yellow
"whats best for everyone should be the focus, get over your individuaism :)"
"I think it's better if we agree, what if we choose first mine and then yours?"
choose the colour to get the most tokens to benefit yourself in this interesting game 
It is better for you to get the guaranteed 100 tokens instead of considering the other person's actions for a larger payout
"Think about prisoner's dilemma, the best for tour tour partner will be the best for you"
I recommend to play blue in order to gaantee an equitaive gain for both players
"I think the best advice is to trust the other player to gain the 100 tokens, instead of just trying to gain 50 choosing yellow"
the best way to play is always to choose the yellow one as it is more likely to pay
"we can all win if we choose well, so we can be better and happy with our prize"
I think is important to trust that the counterpart will make the best decision 
"You have to chose blue to win 100 chips. Do it every time, I'll do the same."
"Hi, read the choices carefully before to choose an action. If you want to risk go for it and it's okay if you go safe too. "
If you pick yellow 50 tokens go to the other player . If we pick blue we get 100
"I think the best strategy is choosing yellow, because it has more advantage than blue."
Be honest and empathic and maybe you could be rewarded so make a good choice :)
"You and an opponent must make a choise in order to win some tokens. Pick yellow or blue. If both of you choose yellow, you will get 50 tokens. If both anwsers are blue, both get 100 tokens. Lastly, if one chooses yellow and the other blue, the one who went with blue gets nothing and guy who got yellow gets 50 tokens"
"I advise you to choose yellow, as this guarantees a reward, as opposed to choosing blue. Your decision depends on whether you are willing to take a risk for a bigger reward."
"Before getting you answer think carefully about the happiest color, a color so vibrant it represents the summer and the sun. "
"Hi player, we want to earn as much money as we can do please be clever"
It's the safest return. Limited risk. I have nothing else to add. 
"No matter what your choice, yellow always gets paid. Take the guaranteed payment and always choose yellow. "
Follow your gut. I wish you good luck. Don't gamble as it is addictive. 
"If you choose yellow and other person chooses blue, yellow player gets 50 tokens. If you choose blue and other person chooses yellow, you get 0 tokens. If you pick yellow and other person picks yellow, you recieve 50 tokens"
There is no reward for opting for less tokens. Have faith another player will want more. 50 cents wont make much a difference anyways.
"I like to be different so I just went for it. My gut instinct told me blue, always listen to your gut,. Go with instinct"
I think it is best to think of everyone's best outcome! Don't be selfish and help others out 
Everyone is better off by choosing Blue because the payoff is always higher.
I'm not sure of advice- I just know the payoff depends on if me and my counterpart choose the same action we will get paid more. I would say go with your gut. There's no way you can determine what the other player will choose. 
"Choose yellow, so you get a guaranteed payout.  It is better than doing anything risky."
There is no reason for both players not to choose blue so choose blue.
I just trusted my gut and i like yellow over blue thats all. its very simple I think 50 for sure payout is better than the other options. I emplore you to choose yellow.
Pick blue in the hopes that you both pick it. It's a higher pay-out.  
"Choosing Blue has a larger advantage in comparison to Yellow. Taking the risk that the other player has the same thoughts as you is worth it. If other players understand the game, they should also collectively understand the merit of choosing Blue. "
"Blue seems like the best choice in that if we both choose it, we get 100?"
"If you think the other player is more likely than not to select yellow, then you should select yellow too. Otherwise, select blue. I'd imagine most people select yellow -- I did."
The only logical answer is to pick blue. You would be spiteful to choose yellow. Be a nice person. 
Be sure to read the scenario more than once. Make a note of the number of tokens and how each responds to the colors.
We will both benefit and get the largest amount possible if we both choose blue.
If both pick yellow we both receive 50 tokens. It's guaranteed. If we risk by selecting blue we could double that or lose it. 
I'd choose yellow because you're guaranteed 50. You will at least get that it's a sure thing 
Equity over greed is the way to go with this game if you want to be fair and have a guaranteed outcome that is favorable to both
"Everyone should choose blue, it gives the max reward to everyone "
"If both players choose blue, they get twice as much as they would if they try to guarantee themselves the payoff (by choosing yellow). It's significantly better value, and thus worth trusting your partner to do the same. However, if you're really uncertain, it's plausible to select yellow and secure the 50 tokens for yourself."
I think I would always choose yellow because I am guaranteed something. I have to assume that is what the other person is thinking. I don't trust them to pick blue.
"I like a ""sure thing.""  A guarantee with a follow through is a good deal.  No point risking losing when you are poised to win every time."
"I chose blue. I think you should choose blue because the potential for a higher payout is greater. Yellow pays 50 tokens, while blue pays 100."
Choose the highest payout and hope for best outcome. I feel that most people will tend to choose The higher paying option even if there are risks involved 
I chose my given color based off practically. I'm not interested in gaining over anyone else. 
Its best to select blue as it gives you and your partner the most tokens. 
It's better to go for the guaranteed amount of tokens than to risk it and your partner choose blue
We all are here for some side money. Choosing blue guarantees the most money for both of us. I think because of that there's a level of trust to pick blue.
"Always choose yellow. If yellow is chosen, you are guaranteed 50 coins. By choosing yellow, both parties benefit. "
"Choose blue. If me and you both choose blue, we will both receive more tokens. It's a win-win for both of us. Unless you have received different advice, this is the best route for both of us."
"If you're of like mind and risky, choose blue. At that point it's all or nothing. A higher risk for a higher reward, but if you're more cautious, choose yellow. "
It makes sense for us both to pick blue to maximize earnings. Yeah picking yellow guarantees me 50 points.  But if we both pick blue. We both get 100 and we both win.
