"*Consider Contributing Fully: Given rate is 1.5, if all players contribute fully, everyone will end up with more tokens than they began with. By contributing all your tokens, you're banking on the possibility of everyone else also contributing fully, resulting in maximum returns for everyone."
"*Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: While contributing fully has the potential for the highest returns, it also carries a risk if other players contribute less or not at all. Depending on your risk tolerance, you might choose to contribute less to mitigate potential losses."
"*Be Mindful of Free Riders: Some players may attempt to take advantage of others by contributing nothing or very little, hoping to benefit from the multiplication of 
others' contributions. This is a risk to consider when deciding how much to contribute."
"*Utilize a Mixed Strategy: You may choose to contribute a portion of your tokens to cover your bases. This way, you stand to benefit from the multiplied public pool while still retaining some of your original endowment in case others don't contribute as much."
"*Reflect on the Greater Good: This game reflects real-world situations where cooperation can lead to greater benefits for all. By contributing a significant amount, you help create a larger pool that, when multiplied, can provide substantial returns for everyone involved."
"*Remember, there's no foolproof strategy in this game. It involves a delicate balance of assessing your risk tolerance, anticipating others' actions, and striving for the collective good."
"*Understand the game. In the game, players have to decide how much of their endowment to contribute to a public good. The more that is contributed to the public good, the greater the benefit to all players. However, players also get a private benefit from not contributing to the public good."
"*Consider the other player's likely strategy. If you think the other player is likely to contribute a lot to the public pool, then you should contribute a lot as well. However, if you think the other player is likely to contribute very little or nothing to the public pool, then you should contribute very little or nothing as well."
"*Aim for a Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is a situation where no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In a public goods game, a Nash equilibrium occurs when all players contribute the same amount to the public pool."
"*Be aware of the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem is the tendency for people to take advantage of the contributions of others without contributing themselves. In this game, this means that some players may contribute very little or nothing to the public good, while others contribute a lot."
"*Start by contributing a moderate amount to the public good. This will signal to the other player that you are willing to cooperate, but that you are also not going to be a free-rider."
"*Be prepared to adjust your strategy if the other player's strategy changes. If the other player contributes more or less to the public good than you expected, you may need to adjust your own contribution accordingly."
"*Don't be afraid to defect. If you think that the other player is not going to contribute to the public good, then you may be better off defecting as well."
"*Ultimately, the best way to play this game is to understand the game, consider the other player's likely strategy, and be aware of the free-rider problem. If you can do all of these things, you will increase your chances of achieving a good outcome."
Putting in a good balance to ensure you get some reward without risking everything.
If they will honestly match your play and give a charity the money then do it. Sometimes it's easier to remember the 50  and the yellow as safe so play it safe and get the money to the pot
Just read the instructions. You can't predict someone else's actions. Pay attention. 
"the more you contribute, the better the return. If you keep your money the value won't increase"
Hedge your bets. On this one have decided to play it safe and hopefully make something back no matter what the other player decides.
I would suggest choosing a low amount. You will end up keeping what you didn't spend and it's the safest way to keep tokens as you don't know what the other person will do. 
"by giving 50 you will end up with the same amount you had, so you must give more than that amount"
50 tokens will show my willingness to increase bonus. it also allows me to have something if the other player doesn't contribute to the fund. I don't want to end up with very less and other player with very high if he doesn't contribute
"If all contributions grow by 50%, then the most logical choice is to invest all the capital"
"I think the best is to choose a good amount of tokens that I want to contribute, to later receive some"
"The more both of you give, the more you receive and I think that when there are 2 participants there is a high chance that we both give at least 50 tokens. If there were more people, the chances would be lower but when there's two of you it's more personal."
"The more tokens you give now the more you will be rewarded at the end of the year, is best to think having the future in consideration"
"Always choose half is to ensure that you will not lose anything, plus you can earn a good percentage of reward, Or if you prefer, you can increase the amount to donate a little more"
You get to keep what you don't put in the public fund plus half of the public fund. putting 100 seems like the best choice for the best outcome for everyone.
Like I said before just a game of luck  and guessing peoples morals. there is no right or wrong answer
"Where the rules are difficult to follow, and you are unsure, it is best to hedge your bets.  try chosing a middling amount so that no one really loses.  the aim is for as many people to get as much as possible"
I wouldn't donate because I don't know what I'm donating to. Half the time a donation goes to waste anyways. I could use the money. 
I'm not sure on this one what is best to do. I just went for 50 to see what will happen.
"There is a higher reward for contributing to the public fund, and not a complete loss so it would be worth while"
Donate it all and we will get 50% more and then itll be shared so it is a good investment to het more money back
It'll be best for everyone to contribute the maximum to the public fund to maximise returns.
Put in zero and there is no risk to you. Anything more than zero risks a loss. If you put in more than zero you're risking the other person putting zero and making a loss.
Always pick largest amount as it is guaranteed growth. Don't be unethical dude.
"Sharing with the public, sharing is always the best way to go with this, greed is bad."
You're given 100 tokens and so if the other player. You chose how many to give to a public fund and the other half is used as playoff 
Providing 50% of your tokens is a fair and ethical outcome for all parties. It allows the public funds to grow whilst maintaining your own token value. It is also morraly correct for all to contribute equally (not token based but value based).
"Again, I tried to think how other players would think in order to have the best chance of a pay off."
If you each contribute 100 then you will end up with 150 each overall which benefits you both. You may get a few more tokens from putting in less but the other person will lose out so the fairest way is to both put in 100.
Stick to sharing and we will all win. If we don't then one of us will lose.
I think putting 50 tokens in is a good choice because you are still retaining some of your own wealth while allowing a healthy contribution to the public fund that also benefits you.
I think you should contribute a high amount. You keep what you didn't contribute but the more we add the more there is in the pot to share 
It is a good thing as it will double. You. just have to hope your partner does the same!
By better 50% of your allowance (100) you're entitled to an equal share of the public fund. The public fund share grows by 50%. You also entitled to keep your remaining tokens (from the 100). 
I don't want to use all of the tokens all at once. As I don't know what the other person is going to choose.
"It is best to put in around half of your tokens, that way you retain some buffer of secuirity incase the other party does not contribute much while alos allowing you to increase your fund"
"I'm not sure where the extra funds are going, so I'm chossing to keep the tokens. I can choose to donate to my own favorite charity after my payout "
I felt it would be fair to give a bit more to the public fund but don't have any concrete advice
I'm not really sure i understand this but i would contribute more if it led to a higher fund at the end
"If we both contribute, we are both likely to receive an income. Otherwise you run the risk of losing out."
50 tokens seems to be the right amount although not sure what the difference is to the final result
Contributing half of the tokens feels like a safe option and still doing the right thing. It still leaves 50 behind which you will get at the end and puts enough into the fund for a good share of this 
I am hoping the other player sees we both have a higher payoff if we both contribute 
The only way you can make 50% is by investing the tokens in the public fund. This is the best way to maximize your tokens. 
50% of the tokens is a good split for social good and personal gain. The public fund still receives a lot of tokens.
Give the maximum amount so you are guaranteed at least 100 tokens back even if the other player contributes 0.
It's a flat 50% gain vs nothing if you decide to save your tokens so choose wisely
There is no real winning formula to this. Just pick a number and go with it. Sharing is fine but not doing is also good.
Any tokens you could have given were already not yours to begin with. Its a gambling game on others good will at this point. Why not gamble that the other person is good enough to do so too?
Somewhere in the middle is probably best but I must admit to not fully understanding this one 
I feel as though this interaction is a bit more tricky as instead of two choices it is a bit more granular. I think the optimal play would be to put a low amount in because of how likely it would be for somebody to put 0.
I though it best to play it safe and contribute half of my tokens to the public fund. That way I have some left and I will get a bonus from the public fund 
Going in the middle seems the fairest way to decide how many tokens to use. Morality and society!
"Investing 100 will give the most return. It is increased by 50%. So if everyone contributes with 100, everyone will get 150."
It seems fair to share equally with the public fund. Splitting the fund seems to give tge best chance of making a good profit. If you feel luckier you might want to put all the money in the fund and get maximum return.
"This is a tricky one. I thought about putting in 100 as if they put in 100 I would get 150 total, but if they put in 0 you get 75. If I put in 50 I am guaranteed 87.5 but could get up to 162.5. If I put in 0 I keep at least 100 but could get up to 175 so I recommend putting none in"
"I think it's worth putting in most or all of your tokens as I expect for the most part you will end up with more than you started with, it's completely ok though if you want to take a safer approach"
It is important to balance risk and reward - only gamble and contribute what you can afford to/don't mind losing
"I'm not a fan of public funds, just dont trust that someone can use the money better than I can, if I wanted to donate I would differently."
"I would put in 80 tokens, leaving 20 tokens in my pot.  If a future player puts in the same amount, we could each receive 40 tokens.  That sounds like a good investment "
Don't be greedy and contribute at least 50% the fund will grow and multiply automatically 
"Read the question in full, think about all the outcomes and make an informed decision"
"You get back an extra 50% of your contribution. if you pay 100, 50% would be 50 tokens. the net income would then be 150."
"You have 100 coins, so can either play with 50 and keep 50 or play with full 100 and maximise the 50% bonus"
"I would suggest going low on your contributions, because you get to keep anything you have left and dont share it. I have gone really low and hope that they go high. Not the most moral but the most profitable to me"
I chose this number based on the explanations previously given. I thought it would make sense like this but this is just an intuition and no ultimate strategy behind my choice. 
"I prefer to give just 10 tokens to the fund because if you gave more then that is very hard to comeback to the 100 tokens again, with this strategy if one guy gives a lot to the fund you will receive a equal share part  of that tokens"
I choose half. That way you'll guarantee that you end with at least the starting money.
"There is no best way to play it but the safest is 0 tokens, although it is very selfish "
It is not risk at this task so you can easily put all of your tokens to maximize profit. 
Invest more and you will get more.  Public fund also grows.  this is best for all
"I chose 50 because it's the example number and it shows how much the gain is, so people that aren't good at math can just choose the ready answer. I believe that the example also gets subconciously chosen more, so my action has to match the most common decision. Lastly, 50 is half of the tokens, which is a good investment number."
"I think by putting 50 tokkens will make me win in a constant rate, but putting all in is way more faster"
"Trustbeats risk even though people can be selfish besides, they'll get the payout and they'll be happy and someone else's happiness should make you happy too"
Give half of your tokns to the funds because they will still increase by 50 percent
Make your decision wisely. Every deposit allows us to increase profits at the end of the game.
"It depends on how many times you play and how well you know the other player. Since I prefer not to trust, and I'm only playing once, then it's better to put zero"
"One more time, we are a team "
You should be consistent with your answer. Choose the best outcome between the both of you
"Just give whatever the amount you feel is right, you will have win something either way i think"
"I think that the safe option is to contribute 50 Tokens to public funds. We don't know how much the other player will contribute, but it can be assumed that the other player will also leave enough for himself. 5O Tokens in stock gives you security that you won't lose too much on the deal."
"You should put everything in the public fund, because that way both player will maximize the bonus and get more tokens"
I think on this occasion it is better to play it safe because you don't know how many tokens the other player is willing to give
I would go with whatever you want it depends on what you want to do
With 100 being given you could end up with 150 tokens which is more than any other option
I really don't know if I did well but i hope you choose the same in the middle
You need to try and maximise your gain. You need to give less and take more. Care about your tokens.
"The payofff can be high risk and high reward, however it should not be an excessive amount considering the total amount you currently have"
"Take some risk in order to gain more, if you're lucky you will be compensated"
"100 coull provide you with a better gain, and will be the best for all"
"I think you get paid half of 50 (25) and then, you reserve the other 50, so you dont have to spend it all"
"If you donate everything you have, you will be able to recover more tokens since more than 25% is always returned"
this is not the best because either we earn the same or we earn less than what we will give
It is best to make the decision that achieves the goal of having the participants get the most reward
"If you put 50 tokens in the fund, as I am doing, we'll have a share of the fund, who will grow to 150 tokens (and not 125 as I answered previously^^)."
"Hi, take in count for each contribution you made will be doubled and you can secure a part of it for you too. This is tricky one, at the same time you help you can get a retribution "
"Its best to give more tokens, because of the growth, regardless of what I did not contributed."
"If you think in the others, both can win a nice quantity of tokens, please be empathic"
"It depends on how much you want to help. If you're looking just for your own benefit, then you should give just a few tokens."
"Be generous with your donation, but not so generous that you end with no money, go with an ethical fair share. "
"If you put out as much money as you can, you will earn the most  :)"
I don't think the advice can be very helpful if I don't know the end result. It could be bad advice
I donated half of my tokens to the public fund. That way I still will get 25 no matter what the public fund ends up being. 
"What you give, comes back to you.  Be kind and considerate of others. Be financially responsible. "
Your contribution will grow by 50%. Payoff is money not invested plus money in stock
It's morally better to contribute. This way everybody can get more. There isn't a reason to opt for less unless you're desperate
I felt like contributing less here was my best call. Again going with gut instinct. Listen to your inner voice whats it telling you to do
It is most profitable to put all tokens in. You get the most return that way no matter what. It doesn't matter what your partner does. 
Adding the full amount to the public fund is the best option. You maximize the amount of money you earn back.
"The results are random. Follow the rules. You'll get paid according to your choice, you have no control of your payoff."
"This situation is like marriage.  If you both cooperate, you both end up benefitting. "
"There is power in contributing.  The more you contribute, the higher it will grow.  It everyone pitches in, everyone benefits."
I am trying to maximize my payoffs. I dont know how I can explain that more in three sentences. I want to win.
"your instructions to this made no sense, so I'm not sure what i'm supposed to do here. if contributions increase by 50% and i don't know what the other person put in, how am I supposed to guage the payout?"
"Choosing to donate to the public fund will benefit you and the fund. Your payoff will include the percentage you have given to the public fund. This way, you are able to help out others and yourself."
"The more tokens you contribute, the more you can earn. If everyone throws in more, the better it is for everyone."
I am not sure how people will react. I would imagine that most people give some tokens to the fund and keep some for themselves. No clue how much people do.
If you both out in all tokens there would be grated reward for all. You should be a team player. All chips in. 
Read the scenarios over and over again. Make sure to note how many tokens each players has.
Contributing half and keeping half of the tokens is the best moral answer because we still benefit from it.
We get 100 tokens and we can donate some to the public fund. The fund grows by 50%
I would give at least half if not more because it's for charity and you will still have some left 
If i were you i would go ahead and donate at least half of all coins so they can double and contribue a fair amount
"I suggest 50 tokens, it balances both risk and reward. If the other player doesn't put anything in, you still get at least 75 tokens "
"It's important to note that contributions to the public fund grow by 50%. There's a significant incentive to work together with the other player(s) and trust them to also do the same, as everyone benefits from it. I recommend making the maximum contribution and contributing all of your tokens into the public fund."
I don't think it is worth contributing anything to the pool. I feel like if anyone contributes they might not really understand why. I feel like it is just smarter move to keep the money instead of hoping it gets redistributed back to you. 
"It might be unethical to be selfish, but why not. Keep it simple and win every round.  Stay safe."
It's probably best to aim higher. 100 tokens is a greater payout. What is there to lose when the stakes are this low?
I'm not sure I completely understand this so I decided to put 50 and hope for the best. 
It just seems like the right thing to do. I wouldn't give much more or less given the instructions 
"While the safest option would be to keep all the tokens for yourself, it is not the best option for manimum payout. To be fair and still have some tokens put back it is best if you only contribute half. It is likely the other person will do the same so it will maximize each of your returns without great risk of the other not contributing."
I think giving half of what you have is the best and right way to go about it
A growth of 50% is quality. Because of this this seems to be a wise choice. I understand though if you choose to keep your 50 tokens.
"Choose 50 coins. By choosing 50, you will increase your coins by 75. By choosing 50, we will maximize our coins.  "
Choose as much to give as you want. I gave 25 tokens. This will be helping a public fund.
This is risk versus reward. If what you put in grows by 50% you could get double what you put in back. You must assess how much you're willing to risk in the end.
It made sense to get the biggest return for my investment and that was the most practical from both ethically helping the neighborhood and maximizing returns.
